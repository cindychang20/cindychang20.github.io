<p class="a">For 24 hours on the last Tuesday of January Lerwick is the location of Shetland's biggest annual fire festival.Up Helly Aa is a type of fire festival held annually from January to March in various communities in Shetland, Scotland to mark the end of the Yule season. Each festival involves a torchlit procession by squads of costumed participants (known as guizers) that culminates in the burning of an imitation Viking galley. The largest festival held in Lerwick, Shetland's capital, involves a procession of up to a thousand guizers who march through the streets of Lerwick on the last Tuesday in January. The other rural festivals (known as the 'country' Up Helly Aas) see lower numbers of participants in accordance with their lower populations.

<p class="a">Songkran is Thailand's most famous festival. An important event on the Buddhist calendar, this water festival marks the beginning of the traditional Thai New Year. The name Songkran comes from a Sanskrit word meaning 'passing' or 'approaching'. Songkran is on 13 April every year, but the holiday period extends from 14 to 15 April.<br>
Water is an important element of Songkran, especially in more recent times when the throwing of water has become a huge part of the annual celebrations. If you're visiting Thailand during this period, prepare to get splashed!

<p class="a">For 24 hours on the last Tuesday of January Lerwick is the location of Shetland's biggest annual fire festival.<br>
Once upon a time, Tomorrowland was just a music festival. It's hard to imagine it now, but early editions didn't have the all-encompassing themes and engrossing mythology that help to shape the whole experience.
Nowadays though, the annual theme is a huge part of the magic, dictating the incredible MainStage design, the immersive production and more or less everything that isn't the lineup of dance music megastars.
The globally adored festival celebrated its 15th Anniversary in 2019, and with the new season fast approaching we've decided to look back over all the themes since the festival's inception.<br>

<p class="a">The Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival, is a holiday for families to get together and enjoy each other's company.Held on the 15th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, the Moon Festival will fall on a Tuesday (Sept. 21) this year. On this day, people in Taiwan eat moon cakes, which symbolize unity and togetherness; stroll under the full moon; grill food on the barbecue; and eat pomelos, since the Chinese term for pomelo sounds like "care and protection."The most familiar myth related to the festival is that of Chang-e flying to the moon after secretly drinking her husband's elixir of life. Aside from this, there are also tales of the Jade Rabbit and of Wu Gang chopping down the cassia tree.
